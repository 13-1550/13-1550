Lab1:

Introuction to using panda 

first we read the file as is and the problem was that the column names were missing.

then we added column names and the so file became more cohearant.

we checked the data types of the columns an found that two types of data were apparent: object and float64.
issue is that some columns that contain numbers appeared as data type= object.

we found that the issue is that there are some missig values

rating            2
review_count      2
isbn            477
booktype          2
author_url        2
year              7
genre_urls       62
dir               0
rating_count      2
name              2

504 rows were missing data

we cleaned the data by replacing nulls with 0 or unknown


we changed the data types of the year an review count to int64

next we split the data to extract the authors name an genre

next we grouped the data to find out which books were best rated each year

conclusion:

in this lab we learned how to extract, edit, modify, and group data.
